      "prompt": "A celestial predator of polished obsidian drifts against a vaporwave horizon of electric blue, outlined by cascading sparks mirroring a fragmented constellation, her form barely contained within a silhouette of ancient, levitating monoliths emitting a subsonic hum, the entire scene rendered with hyperrealistic detail as if sculpted from light and shadow, evoking a sense of both raw power and melancholic grace\u2014detailed fur texture catching the glow of neon energy, circuitry-like patterns subtly etched across her muscular frame, a sense of immense scale emphasized by the minimalist background punctuated by distant, glitching geometric shapes, the overall aesthetic a blend of organic majesty and digital decay, reminiscent of concept art for a futuristic mythology; imagine the work of Beeple meets Frank Frazetta, each scale and crackle of energy painstakingly rendered at 8k resolution, utilizing subsurface scattering to convey the internal luminescence of the creature, atmospheric perspective adding depth to the blue monochrome gradient, and subtle chromatic aberration reinforcing the synthwave vibe\u2014this is not merely an image, but a digital artifact of a forgotten age, imbued with weight and emotion, a photorealistic painting so vivid it feels tangible, a VFX masterpiece pushing the boundaries of CGI, with layers of post-processing to achieve a cinematic depth of field and bloom effect.",
