      "prompt": "A spectral guardian, wreathed in the glow of projected lunar luminescence and blossoming arterial hues, stands as a darkly elegant silhouette against a backdrop crackling with unseen energy, her form emerging from the stark depths of a charcoal study as if drawn by the very static in the air, evoking a sense of ancient, watchful power and ethereal sorrow \u2013 a digital painting rendered with hyperrealism, focusing on the subtle textures of skin and flowing garments, the individual strands of hair caught in the electrostatic field, utilizing subsurface scattering to mimic the diffusion of light through translucent elements, and employing a high dynamic range to accentuate the contrasts between the moody shadows and the vibrant crimson blooms\u2014the artwork should be reminiscent of Greg Rutkowski and Alphonse Mucha, infused with the cinematic quality of a modern blockbuster still, boasting intricate details like micro-fractals within the energy discharges and a dust mote atmosphere, presented at 8k resolution with global illumination and ambient occlusion for realistic depth and a tangible atmosphere, aiming for a photorealistic yet subtly fantastical aesthetic, further enhanced with post-processing effects such as bloom and chromatic aberration to heighten the emotional impact.",
