      "prompt": "Imagine a luminous neon dancer, her slender silhouette traced in fluid ink sketch lines that pulse with the electric rhythm of a nocturnal club, her flowing costume rendered in a haunting palette of warm ochre glows and cold grey\u2011steel accents that catch the soft, diffused glow of a hidden projector casting a veil of luminous mist over the stage, the viewer\u2019s eye is drawn into a swirling vortex perspective that spirals toward her pupils like twin black holes, each blink releasing streams of digital tears that pixelate into tiny holographic droplets, reflecting the surrounding light in a cascade of iridescent code, while the composition balances the tactile realism of a high\u2011resolution portrait with the sleek precision of CGI rendering, every line and gradient rendered with painstaking digital brushwork that mimics the texture of traditional ink yet glistens like polished metal, the atmosphere is simultaneously intimate and otherworldly, a perfect fusion of concept\u2011art narrative and hyper\u2011realistic digital artwork that invites the observer to feel the kinetic energy of the dancer\u2019s movement frozen in a single, breathless moment.",
