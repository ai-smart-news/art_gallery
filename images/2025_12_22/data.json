      "prompt": "Within a narrowing aperture of perception, a phantom fox wrought of swirling rose and burning ochre emerges from dissipating, luminescent trails, its form fractured and embellished with the ornate grotesqueries of a forgotten dynasty, all bathed in the splintered radiance of shattered, internal light \u2013 a vision simultaneously majestic and decaying, rendered with the hyperrealism of digital painting, resembling a baroque masterwork meticulously sculpted in light and shadow, utilizing subsurface scattering to portray ethereal translucence, exhibiting a complex interplay of fine detail in the fur texture and the intricate carving of bone-like ornamentation, presented as a cinematic grade CGI artwork with global illumination and intricate ray tracing, evoking a sense of otherworldly melancholia and sublime horror, achieving a level of photorealistic detail comparable to a high-resolution portrait while simultaneously leaning into the fantastical and dreamlike, incorporating volumetric fog and subtle chromatic aberration to enhance the immersive quality, reminiscent of Greg Rutkowski and Alphonse Mucha blended with Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski\u2019s unsettling beauty, all presented in a wide aspect ratio for maximum impact.",
