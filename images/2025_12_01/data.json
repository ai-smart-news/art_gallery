      "prompt": "An ethereal sovereign of the cosmos pulses with molten silver radiance, her form a vast, bioluminescent being echoing the grace of jellyfish and the regality of a queen, dissolving into trails of incandescent fluid as if sculpted by a sacred flame within a cavernous dark, the scene viewed from a subtly skewed angle revealing cascading rivulets of light and shadow\u2014a digital painting rendered with hyperrealism, mimicking the texture and chaotic beauty of Jackson Pollock\u2019s drip technique yet achieving photorealistic detail in the creature's translucent membranes and the swirling nebulae contained *within* her being; imagine subsurface scattering illuminating the shimmering internal structures, nuanced lighting suggesting a celestial cathedral, and a high dynamic range emphasizing the contrast between the blazing core and the fading extremities\u2014a truly immersive artwork pushing the boundaries of CGI, aiming for a quality comparable to concept art for a sci-fi epic, with extraordinary attention to detail in the flowing, dripping luminescence that feels both weightless and incredibly substantial, presented as a flawlessly polished, high-resolution image demanding close inspection of its intricate complexities, worthy of a gallery display examining the potential fusion of organic life and cosmic phenomena.",
