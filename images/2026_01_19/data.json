      "prompt": "A figure steeped in prophetic sorrow gazes from the periphery of vision, bathed in the ethereal glow of a tempestuous, rose-tinted heaven and smoldering twilight, her presence distilled to essential form amidst a delicate fracturing of reality where crystalline splinters hang suspended like frozen lightning, suggesting both fragility and potent, otherworldly insight \u2013 a hyperrealistic digital painting, utilizing subsurface scattering to render skin with luminous translucence, high-frequency detail to capture the texture of fine fabrics and the sharpness of broken glass, employing a cinematic depth of field to focus attention on the subject's emotionally charged eyes, echoing the melancholic beauty of a pre-Raphaelite portrait reimagined through a modern, minimalist lens with soft global illumination and ambient occlusion to enhance the sense of volumetric presence, meticulously crafted in CGI to achieve photorealistic textures and subtle imperfections, resulting in a compelling and emotionally resonant image\u2014rendered at 8k resolution with an emphasis on atmospheric perspective and dynamic lighting that sculpts form and conveys narrative weight, leaning toward the style of Greg Rutkowski and Artgerm but with a distinctly subdued, emotionally evocative color story.",

      "prompt": "From a godlike vantage, witness the ethereal core of royalty besieged by tempestuous power, a golden, fractured luminescence bleeding through swirling volcanic mists to illuminate the intricate, biomechanical heart of a sovereign adrift within a crumbling obsidian fortress \u2013 her form a haunting convergence of flesh and circuitry, overlaid with shimmering, glyph-etched projections that pulse with arcane energy as she oversees the failing defenses of a world consumed by shadow, rendered in hyperrealistic detail with the textural grit of mythic horror and the opulent decay of forgotten ages, a digital painting evoking both majestic power and encroaching doom, visualized as a complex cutaway revealing the luminous architecture within her very being, reminiscent of HR Giger meets Alphonse Mucha, pushing the boundaries of CGI realism with subsurface scattering, bloom, and atmospheric perspective to create a truly immersive and disturbing spectacle, reaching a resolution of 8k and utilizing physically based rendering for ultra-fine detail in every holographic strand and weathered stone.",
