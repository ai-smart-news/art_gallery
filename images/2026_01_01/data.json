      "prompt": "A fractured echo of remembrance coalesces into a silver-scorched visage, her face a palimpsest of ancient glyphs illuminated by the erratic dance of sparking, ethereal flames \u2013 a close-cropped portrait reminiscent of a forgotten art deco advertisement, rendered with painstaking detail as if painstakingly etched onto polished obsidian, the light catching the delicate filigree of memory itself, evoking a sense of fleeting beauty and powerful, half-understood histories, the overall aesthetic leaning towards hyperrealism blended with the stylized grace of early 20th-century illustration, showcasing minute pores and individual strands of hair as if captured with a macro lens, yet possessing the painted quality of a masterwork \u2013 a digital painting with cinematic lighting and intricate textures, highly detailed facial features and a melancholic expression, aiming for photorealistic quality while maintaining a fantastical, otherworldly air, rendered in 8k resolution with volumetric lighting and global illumination, utilizing subsurface scattering for realistic skin tones, and employing a shallow depth of field to focus attention on the captivating eyes, reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha's portraiture combined with the dramatic contrast of film noir.",
