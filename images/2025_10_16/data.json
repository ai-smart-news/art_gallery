      "prompt": "In the bright, neon-lit darkness of a distant orbital sky, the majestic space jellyfish queen rises like a luminous monarch of the void, her translucent, iridescent bell shimmering with wisps of storm plum and electric smoke color that ripples across the glassy, biopunk-infused surface of her shell, while sleek, lattice\u2011work cybernetic tentacles wrap like armored vines around her regal crown of crystalline coils and bioluminescent filaments, each strand pulsing with spectral blue, violet, and amber hues that mirror the distant auroras of distant moons, all rendered in hyper\u2011realistic CGI that captures every delicate texture, from the fine, ruby\u2011tinted veins on her translucent body to the faint copper filigree etched into the silvered edges of her antennae, as a subtle, diffused dreamlight washes over her face, imbuing the scene with a dreamy, ethereal glow, yet unmistakably anchored in a stark, futuristic palette that saturates the composition, while a dramatic, cinematic lens flare arcs across the scene, scattering shards of starlight across the swirling clouds, and the flat, head\u2011on perspective anchors her in studyial stance, commanding the viewer with an austere, commanding presence that balances the fragility of a jellyfish with the indomitable strength of a technological empire, capturing the essence of her realm in a single, breathtaking, single-line portrayal that feels both a portrait and a portal into a neon\u2011haunted galaxy of ambition and wonder.",
