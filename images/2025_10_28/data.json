      "prompt": "In the shattered heart of a neon\u2011burnt metropolis, a towering tech valkyrie stands in a striking frontal symmetry, her cybernetic armor a seamless fusion of rusted orange\u2011tinged metal and cobalt\u2011blue circuitry that glows like liquid fire, the glow pulsing and melting into an iridescent neon haze that shimmers across the crumbling concrete and twisted steel, while her visor\u2014an intricate lattice of translucent glass\u2014reflects fractured reflections of a sky bleached by distant explosions, and around her, digital tears stream down her cheeks like holographic rain, each droplet refracting the electric light into a kaleidoscope of colors that dance across her polished chrome limbs, her wings a complex array of carbon fiber feathers that seem to flicker with embedded LEDs, casting a soft, otherworldly glow that illuminates the broken streets and the scattered relics of a once\u2011thriving civilization, while in the background, broken billboards flicker with glitching advertisements in neon rust and cobalt tones, the scene rendered with hyper\u2011realistic detail and CGI precision, creating a hauntingly beautiful portrait that captures the stark, post\u2011apocalyptic beauty of a future where technology and myth merge under a sky forever alight with melting neon and the bittersweet resonance of digital tears.",
