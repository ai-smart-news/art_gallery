      "prompt": "In the heart of a colossal, frost\u2011shrouded sanctuary where the vaulted ceiling itself seems to pulse with a quiet, humming resonance, a lone figure stands\u2014an ethereal Hollow Echo Maiden whose translucent skin is laced with avenues of faint, silvery light that flicker like distant stars, her hair woven with strands of obsidian fiber and faint, iridescent crystal webs that catch every ray of the room\u2019s cold, temple light, a silvery cascade that makes the ancient carved columns appear as if they were slicing into a moonlit lake, and the reflective surface of a polished obsidian altar below her mirrors the surreal scene with uncanny fidelity, allowing her to see her own ghostly silhouette layered upon herself so that the drapes of her robes ripple in a delicate interplay between the burnished sienna that stains the altar\u2019s aged marble and the icy glacier blues that run like veins through the architecture itself, all rendered in a masterful CGI style that balances hyper\u2010realistic detail with the bold, textural punch of afrofuturism: the sharp, geometric patterns etched into her costume echo the symmetry of her culture\u2019s ancestral tattoos, made stark against the cool starlight that filters through the stained\u2011glass arches, and the crystal webs, bound with delicate, glass\u2011like threads of light, seem to intertwine her presence with that glitching, almost liquid shimmer of a digital dreamscape, while the cold temple light refracts from the mirrored surface into shards that illuminate the exquisite metallic trinkets flanking her\u2019s hips, revealing the subtle sheen of copper spirals braided into her hair, and the faint, ghostly laughter of the echo that surrounds her, audible only to the eyes that dare to follow her every whispering step across the reflective ground that plays a cosmic jigsaw of her travelled memories in old brass and pearl\u2011white ice, a portrait of a woman who carries the weight of a hollow echo within every graceful gesture, yet whose spirit glows in a radiant play of burnt sienna warmth and the stark, crystalline clarity of glacier peaks, making it a concept art masterpiece that could exist as both a digital sculpture and a living, breathing tapestry within the realms of Afrofuturism, entrancing the observer with its immersive depth while also reminding them that every fracture of light on her visage is a memory refracted through cold, reverent walls that keep the echo silent but echoing, and it is through the crystal webs that glimmer like new stars caught in the thick silence that the vision of the Hollow Echo Maiden pours forth, a stunning presence in a scene of improbable yet inevitable enchantment, a single still frame that hums with otherworldly majesty, echoing like a lullaby in the silence of a temple made of pure light, a visual enchantment rendered in hyper\u2011realistic detail and vibrant, dynamic color, a portrait that invites the viewer to look deep into her reflection and find the space where the old world and a brilliant, uncharted future kiss amid the luminous glow of a bewildering, mystic cathedral, and the result is a singular, ethereal, ablaze image that feels both ancient and future\u2011forward, alive, and once again reminding us in that stillness that the echo is only a whisper of a complete story inside an endless kaleidoscope of light, color, and myth, all captured in a single sentence that drips with luscious words.",
