      "prompt": "From an over\u2011the\u2011shoulder view, a radiant sky serpentess coils through the heavens, her gossamer scales rendered in stark charcoal strokes that hint at subtle translucency, while a gentle crescent glow bathes the scene in a soft marble twilight that casts elongated shadows in platinum and deep maroon, the shifting hues of her iridescent wings caught between the dramatic contrast of charcoal linework and the seamless detail of digital CGI, and as her sinuous body winds around how many layers of infinite mirrors, each angled precisely to catch and multiply the glow, reflect a cascading kaleidoscope of the celestial light, creating the illusion that the boundaries of the image dissolve into endless, glowing reprises of the serpentine figure, every scale and feather detailed with realistic textures that mimic the tactile feel of charcoal on paper yet enhanced by the precision of 3\u2011D rendering, and the air above the serpentess hums with subtle orbs of phosphorescent mist, casting an ethereal veil over the marble twilight spectrum, while the underlying environment is a desolate, moonless sky that heightens the dramatic atmosphere, making the viewer feel as though they are standing behind the very feathers of the creature, surrounded by layers upon layers of reflective surfaces, all unified under a single artistic vision that marries the raw power of brushwork with the limitless potential of digital artistry, yielding a breathtaking portrait that balances stark charcoal realism with the luminous elegance of a marble cosmic dance, as if the artist had carved the scene from stardust itself.",
