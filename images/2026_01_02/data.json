      "prompt": "Within an impossibly long corridor of cooling, obsidian flows and shimmering rose-quartz veins, a serpentine form of polished, scale-like glass catches the light of a fractured, internal sun\u2014a luminescence born not of heat but of fractured perception\u2014revealing the regal profile of a dragoness whose very being seems to refract and distort the infinite perspective, her contours subtly echoing the molten stone architecture around her, and radiating an ethereal glow reminiscent of a black opal held to the light, a breathtakingly detailed and hyperrealistic depiction manifesting as a masterful blend of digital painting and sophisticated CGI, pushing the boundaries of photorealism with exquisite attention to subsurface scattering within the glass scales, intricately detailed textures of cooling lava flows, and a subtly volumetric atmosphere hinting at immense scale and ancient power, evoking a sense of melancholic majesty and otherworldly beauty, meticulously rendered with global illumination and ray tracing for stunning realism and clarity, approaching the quality of a cinematic concept art piece destined for a high-fantasy epic, further enhanced by fine details like the minute imperfections and swirling patterns within the opal-esque coloration, reminiscent of the finest oil painting techniques translated into the digital realm, generating an image with dramatic lighting and high dynamic range.",
