      "prompt": "In the twilight of a luminous eclipse, a gravity sage maiden drifts across an oblique glass sliver, her silvery robes swirling like mercury, each droplet of water caught mid-burst, reflecting emerald and obsidian tones that pulse with vaporwave synthwave neon, her eyes glowing with the weight of forgotten constellations, her outstretched hand guiding the falling droplets into a cascade of shimmering bioluminescent ripples that bleed into a dreamlike horizon where pixelated waves merge with the starry void, while the ambient light casts a soft, iridescent glow that shadows her elongated silhouette, the scene rendered in hyperrealistic digital artwork with fine CGI detail that captures the delicate translucency of glass, the crispness of water, and the surreal, pastel-hued dreamscape of retro-futuristic aesthetics, all while the composition feels like a celestial playlist of glowing synth chords and drifting, pulsating notes, inviting the viewer into an immersive, luminous, and otherworldly realm that balances the ancient wisdom of a sage with the electric vibrancy of a vaporwave dream, every element harmoniously synchronized with the rhythm of a cosmic eclipse that is both a portal and a mirror, echoing the paradoxical dance of gravity and light, a visual poem that transcends time and color.",
