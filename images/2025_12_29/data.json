Her form should be humanoid but with elegantly elongated proportions and subtly avian features \u2013 implied plumage rather than fully developed wings. The lighting is crucial; it's not simply *bright*, but a diffuse, shimmering radiance *emanating* from the figure and the stones, creating strong contrasts and emphasizing the impressionistic style. Detail is paramount - individual 'fractures' within the obsidian-like elements, the minute grains of sand kicked up by unseen breezes in the mirage effect, the subtle imperfections in the levitating stones. The 'corridor' is less about architectural precision and more about framing \u2013 hinted at through rough-hewn stone and deep shadows, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the central figure and creating a sense of awe and mystery. The overall impression should be magical realism, something that *could* exist, but simultaneously feels otherworldly and profoundly beautiful.",
