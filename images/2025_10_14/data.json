      "prompt": "Within a dimly lit, angular chamber that projects an uncanny three\u2011dimensional illusion, a towering skeletal golem, its ribs and joints rendered with hyper\u2011realistic detail and a subtle, almost translucent translucency, stands poised as a living sculpture of bone and steel, its form dripping with a vivid, almost liquid paint effect that seems to bleed electric blue and rust tones across its marrow\u2011filled sinews, while pulsating strobe lights flicker in sync with a rhythmic heartbeat, casting dramatic, shifting shadows that dance across the walls and the surrounding floor, and the entire scene is framed by a tangle of energy\u2011charged vines that pulse and writhe with a bioluminescent glow that mirrors the strobe\u2019s cadence, each tendril interwoven with veins of glowing copper and azure light, giving the impression that the vines themselves are conduits of the golem\u2019s inner power; the perspective feels as though one is looking down from an elevated angle, watching the golem\u2019s skeletal silhouette loom over the room, its limbs forming an ominous, almost cathedral\u2011like arch that frames the pulsating light and the dripping paint, while the edges of the composition are softened by a subtle blur that suggests motion and a dream\u2011like haze, yet the digital rendering maintains a crisp, hyper\u2011realistic texture that captures every crack in the bone, every speck of dust, and every flicker of electric blue light, creating a breathtaking tableau that combines the ancient, macabre beauty of a bone golem with the modern, visceral intensity of drip painting, strobe illumination, and the electric, rust\u2011colored palette, all while immersing the viewer in a surreal, almost cinematic experience that feels both eerie and awe\u2011inspiring.",
