      "prompt": "A translucent glass phoenix maiden, her iridescent wings like finely wrought crystal shards, materializes amid an abandoned attic that quivers under eerie twilight, the dusty bricks and slanted eaves rendered in stark ink sketch strokes, where ever\u2011shifting obsidian shadows flicker against emerald vines that curl around her skeletal hands, each feather a delicate lattice of light and darkness, her eyes a luminous teal ember reflecting the low sun\u2019s dying glow, and the angled room projection casts dramatic chiaroscuro shadows across the floorboards, as the air shivers with a silent wind that seems to carry whispers of forgotten ash, while subtle, almost imperceptible ripples ripple through the glass texture of her form, making her presence both fragile and fiercely alive, the overall composition a masterful blend of digital realism and meticulous CGI detail that elevates the mythic creature into a hauntingly beautiful, atmospheric portrait of ethereal wonder that breathes new myth, with ethereal fire.",
