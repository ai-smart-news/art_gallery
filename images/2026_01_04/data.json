      "prompt": "A spectral figure, imbued with the kinetic energy of a forgotten broadcast, pulses within a geometrically fractured cityscape, her form dissolving into trails of ascending shadow as the air around her crackles with an ethereal, unstable luminescence \u2013 a cool, bioluminescent viridescence bleeding into the deepest charcoal, reminiscent of early animation cel techniques yet rendered with hyperrealistic detail, showcasing complex layering of translucent textures and particulate matter suggesting both decay and nascent creation, the entire composition framed as a stark, backlit silhouette against a subtly glitching backdrop that hints at corrupted data streams and the fading echoes of a retro-futuristic dream, evoking a sense of melancholic beauty and transient existence, enhanced by the illusion of volumetric lighting and subsurface scattering within the smoke-like emanations, creating a strikingly dramatic and emotionally resonant digital painting with a distinctly analog heart, pushing the boundaries of photorealism through stylized abstraction, leaning towards a highly detailed aesthetic inspired by Yoshitaka Amano and Ren\u00e9 Laloux, generating a compelling narrative within a single, arresting image \u2013 achieved through advanced rendering techniques and a painterly post-processing approach.",
