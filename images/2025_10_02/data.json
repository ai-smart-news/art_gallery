      "prompt": "At the break of a misty dawn, a gravity sage maiden stands poised in a spiraling, twisted baroque tableau, her silver and wine\u2011hued robes flowing like liquid metal around intricate mechanical joints that gleam beneath a lavender mist, her eyes reflecting the fragile equilibrium of celestial forces, her posture exuding a serene yet uncanny wisdom, the background a swirling vortex of fractured arches and ornate filigree, punctuated with delicate filaments of light that dance like unseen constellations, all rendered in hyperrealistic digital artistry with CGI precision, the atmosphere thick with an ethereal hush and the subtle scent of ancient parchment, as if the very air is a living parchment that cradles the sage\u2019s silent incantations, and the perspective spirals gracefully inward, drawing the viewer into a cosmic spiral of shadow and light that frames her as both guardian of gravity and muse of the impossible, an embodiment of both timeless elegance and mechanized grace, woven together by a palette of lavender, silver, and wine that glows softly against the soft dawn mist, creating a portrait that feels simultaneously otherworldly and profoundly tangible, inviting the eye to linger in its lingering, dreamlike resonance.",
