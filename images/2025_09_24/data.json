      "prompt": "A hyper\u2011realistic digital portrait of a flesh\u2011bound automaton, its sinewy, metallic musculature glinting under a stark, unforgiving spotlight that carves deep chiaroscuro across the scene, while the surrounding environment swirls with diesel\u2011age machinery\u2014grimy brass cogs, riveted steel panels, and vapor\u2011filled exhaust pipes rendered in a dreamlike pastel gradient sky that shifts from soft lavender to mint\u2011green and blush\u2011pink, the figure reflected endlessly in a labyrinth of fragmented mirrors that duplicate and slightly offset its visage into an echoing kaleidoscope of silhouettes, each replica subtly distorted by swirling ink\u2011like tendrils that writhe and dissolve like liquid calligraphy, their volatile forms merging with the gritty, oil\u2011slick textures of the background, all composed in ultra\u2011detailed CGI style that blurs the line between organic and mechanical, giving the impression of a living sculpture caught in a perpetual dance of light, shadow, and ever\u2011changing pigment, as if a silent symphony of industrial decay and ethereal beauty were frozen in a single, mesmerizing moment.",
