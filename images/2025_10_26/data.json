      "prompt": "Imagine a colossal cloud leviathan, its maw and nostrils a swirling tapestry of vapor that spirals like a luminous serpent through a surreal sky where the silver\u2011gold sheen of liquid chrome drips down like rivers of molten steel, reflecting the warm, ceremonial embers that pulse from unseen fires at its heart, imbuing the monstrous vaporscape with a gentle glow that stirs dust beige ash into shimmering, translucent ribbons that kiss the edges of the creature's sinuous body, while the vast horizon is painted in ocean steel tones that deepen toward the horizon as if the very sky were a vast, reflective deep sea, all captured from a reverse eclipse perspective that places the viewer inside the abyssal core of the cosmos watching the leviathan as it ascends into the darkness, and above and beyond the creature's flowing form, intricate star charts etched into the cloud like ancient rune maps unfurl across the blackened heavens, their luminescent constellations intertwined with the creature's phosphorescent veins and lending a sense of infinite navigation through the boundless void, a breathtaking canvas of intricate CG artistry that pulls the eye across layers of texture, motion, and iridescence, inviting the imagination to drift with every glimmering ember and star\u2011studded arc toward an otherworldly horizon where the very edges of reality pulse like a living, breathing organism, and the entire panorama feels like a living poem made of light, vapor, and steel, forever captured in high\u2011resolution digital realism that grounds the mythical monster in a tangible representation of dreamlike spectacle.",
