      "prompt": "A solitary figure, fractured and echoing across a void of deepening carbon, moves with impossible grace as spectral plasma light pulses and fades, illuminating the scattering of paper lanterns adrift in a blurred current \u2013 a dance of self-reflection captured mid-flow, rendered in the evocative simplicity of organic forms and a haunting luminescence that feels both ancient and utterly new, suggesting a fleeting memory or a dream struggling to coalesce, the aesthetic akin to highly detailed digital painting with a focus on subtle gradients and textural intricacies, leaning into photorealistic qualities but retaining a painterly finish; imagine smooth, porcelain skin subtly catching the green glow, the flowing fabric of her garments trailing like smoke, each lantern a miniature star casting elongated, ethereal shadows, and the overall composition evoking a sense of poignant loneliness and otherworldly beauty, with a hyperdetailed focus on hair strands and the delicate creases of her expression, and the entire scene partially obscured by soft motion blur, the effect achieved through advanced rendering techniques to simulate realistic light scattering and atmospheric perspective, creating a captivating and immersive visual experience \u2013 a perfect blend of realism, fantasy, and artistic expression designed for ultra-high resolution display.",
