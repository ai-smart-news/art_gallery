      "prompt": "At the hush of a twilight meadow, a gleaming panther automaton leans against the jagged edge of a cliff, its alloyed spine subtly carved in pearl\u2011white chrome and next to it a scarlet glow from its heart actuator, a cascade of time\u2011locked particles swirling like constellations around its poised paws, hyperrealistically rendered in CGI to reveal every intricate gear and sleek muscle beneath a sky bruised with dusky lavender, and tiny fireflies alight upon the damp grass, their bioluminescent trails painting delicate ribbons across the fading light, while shadows soften the automaton's silhouette into an almost liquid reflection upon the cliff's craggy flank, and the whole composition framed like a painterly study of motion caught in a single breath, capturing a moment where mechanical grace meets the poetry of dusk, where each gleam of the pearl\u2011white body catches the scarlet glare of the setting sun, and the time\u2011locked particles cling like glass snowflakes to the air, creating a surreal sense of suspended reality that makes the digital artwork feel both hyperreal and dreamlike in equal measure.",
