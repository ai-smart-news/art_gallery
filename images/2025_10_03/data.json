      "prompt": "Immersed in the nostalgic glow of a vintage poster, a radiant sun archangel with iridescent wings of electric blue streaked in rusted bronze glimmers with an aura that seems to drip with crystalline ice, its wings unfurling in a majestic sweep that forms a halo of frosted light refracting across the shattered glass frame that surrounds the scene, each fractured pane catching and scattering the glow, reflecting ancient carvings etched into the edges of the glass as if the very stones were whispering forgotten histories, the portrait is rendered in hyperrealistic CGI with meticulous attention to texture and light, the angel\u2019s golden halo is defined by crisp icy facets that catch the light like a thousand tiny mirrors, while the background is a soft, muted landscape of distant horizons hinting at ancient ruins, the overall palette balances the cool electric blue of the angel\u2019s wings with warm earthy rust tones that give depth and contrast, all of which combine to create a surreal cinematic feeling that invites the viewer to step into a timeless moment where celestial power meets ancient artistry, and the broken glass acts not as a mere backdrop but as an integral part of the composition that magnifies every glint, every shadow, every whisper of history, making the whole scene feel like a living tapestry of light, color, and memory.",
