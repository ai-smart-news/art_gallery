      "prompt": "In a dimly lit fog\u2011shrouded corridor that seems to stretch into an endless twilight, a core priestess stands as the solitary focus, her visage rendered in the delicate linework and muted yet vibrant hues of vintage anime, her flowing robes edged with a faint luminescent ice that radiates an ethereal chill, casting prismatic glints on the coral\u2011tinged dusk sky outside the narrow windows while the surrounding stone walls glow with a cold tech\u2011gray sheen, the atmosphere thick with drifting mist that catches the light like shattered glass, and tattered ceremonial flags hang limp from rusted sconces, their frayed edges fluttering in a silent breeze that carries whispers of ancient chants, each flag bearing faded sigils that pulse faintly with lost power, while the priestess\u2019s eyes, deep and reflective, mirror the icy radiance, and her hands are clasped around a luminous crystal staff that seems to draw the very temperature of the corridor into a swirling vortex of frost, all elements merging into a single, richly detailed tableau that feels both nostalgic and futuristic, a hauntingly beautiful convergence of coral warmth and metallic cold, inviting the viewer to step into a world where myth and technology intertwine.",
