      "prompt": "A radiant being of celestial luminescence, fractured and revealed through a blossoming, pearl-white cavern formed from living stone, exhales scarlet echoes into swirling spore clouds as a fragmented, hallucinatory sun bleeds across the vista, evoking the awe-inspiring power of ancient myth and a sense of witnessing genesis itself \u2013 rendered as hyperdetailed digital painting with volumetric lighting, reminiscent of Brom\u2019s fantasy illustrations and the vibrant color palettes of Alphonse Mucha, pushing the boundaries of realistic portraiture into a realm of otherworldly beauty, utilizing subsurface scattering on the angelic figure\u2019s form and intricate, bioluminescent details within the cavern walls, textures crafted with photorealistic CGI techniques to create a sense of tangible, organic growth, and an overall composition aiming for cinematic quality and breathtaking scale, blending elements of classical sculpture and baroque extravagance with a distinctly modern, high-resolution aesthetic, featuring delicate filigree patterns embedded within the spore clouds and subtle chromatic aberration to enhance the feeling of a dreamlike, unstable reality, ultimately striving for an image that feels both monumental and deeply personal, captivating the viewer with its sheer imaginative force and technical brilliance.",
