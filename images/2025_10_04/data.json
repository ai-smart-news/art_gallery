      "prompt": "From a distant, orbital view, the hollow echo maiden drifts above a blazing skyline that erupts in flickering orange and crimson against the ruinous clouds, her translucent mask shimmering with faint echoes of wind, while her flowing robes billow like ink\u2011wash clouds in a classic Japanese sumi\u2011sh\u016b style, each stroke a delicate stroke of storm\u2011gray muted tones trembling against a backdrop of royal\u2011purple night, the scene rendered with hyper\u2011real CGI fidelity that captures even the subtle play of light on her porcelain skin, the ambient digital noise overlaying the edges of the image like a faint grain of sand that gives the tableau a calligraphic texture, and the full composition is dominated by the sense of hovering, weight\u2011less flight that makes the viewer feel an orbiting, reverent stillness amid the chaos of a world painted in twilight shadows, the flame\u2019s heat rendered as soft glow that illuminates the aura around her, turning her quiet silhouette into a living brushstroke of celestial ink.",
