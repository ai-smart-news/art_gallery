      "prompt": "A fractured vision of a desert prophetess, seemingly woven from shifting sands and corroded metal, materializes within a heat-haze distortion, her form partially dissolving into glitched, ochre-toned particles as an internal luminescence bleeds outwards, casting long, grey shadows against a boundless horizon \u2013 a side-view perspective revealing layered depths of both physical and digital decay, resembling a displaced memory rendered in hyperrealistic detail with the unsettling beauty of corrupted data, evoking a sense of ancient power struggling against disintegration, akin to a meticulously crafted digital painting blending photorealistic human anatomy with the chaotic energy of datamoshing and the sublime quality of cinematic lighting; the skin texture should exhibit subtle imperfections, reflecting years exposed to harsh elements, while the metallic accents boast a pitted, oxidized surface, and the overall composition emphasizes dynamic tension between fragility and strength, prioritizing intricate detail in the flowing fabrics and the subtle play of light across the figure's weathered face, delivered as cutting-edge CGI artwork with an otherworldly and desolate atmosphere, aiming for a quality comparable to leading concept art for a high-budget science fantasy film \u2013 a post-processing effect of chromatic aberration and subtle bloom should further enhance the sense of unreality and ethereal presence.",
