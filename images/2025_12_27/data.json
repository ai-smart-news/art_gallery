      "prompt": "Within a fractured, echoing expanse resembling the inverted throat of a leviathan, a figure of forgotten grace \u2013 remnants of coral and pearl woven into her form \u2013 drifts amidst the luminescence of fragmented geometries, bathed in the ethereal glow of a submerged moon, her face dissolving into crystalline rivulets mirroring the cold, steel-grey depths while dust-colored fractal blooms emanate from her dissolving form, suggesting a sorrowful monument to a lost civilization rendered in exquisitely detailed, hyperrealistic digital painting with cinematic lighting and a profound sense of melancholic beauty, leaning towards a CGI aesthetic that blends organic forms with mathematically precise structures, exhibiting subsurface scattering on the 'skin' and iridescent qualities on the 'pearl' and 'coral', the overall impression a hauntingly beautiful and deeply textural artwork reminiscent of Beeple meets Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski, with a focus on intricate detail and atmospheric perspective to convey immense scale and emotional weight, utilizing volumetric god rays piercing through the fractured 'ceiling' and subtle chromatic aberration to enhance the sense of depth and unreality, and pushing the boundaries of photorealism within a fantastical context, utilizing 8k resolution and intricate procedural textures.",
