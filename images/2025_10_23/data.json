      "prompt": "In the crumbling aftermath of a shattered city, a solitary core priestess stands at the broken edge of a once\u2011fortified wall, her silvered eyes glowing with an inner fire, as diffused laser pulses slice through the oppressive, cloud\u2011shrouded twilight, painting her alabaster robes with streaks of scarlet that bleed into the cracked concrete and the disordered roots of salvaged machines groaning like ancient fauna beneath her boots, her hair a chaotic tapestry of ferrous filaments that catch the harsh, augmented light, while the sky above is a blend of stormy ether and crimson shards of meteoric debris, rendered in hyperrealistic CGI that caresses every vein, shadow and texture, and the entire scene is embedded with a subtle cinematic depth of field that follows the fractured architectural traces left on the wall\u2014front\u2011lit by the pulse of a distant energy source\u2014creating an immersive, post\u2011apocalyptic tableau that feels both eerily serene and violently alive.",
