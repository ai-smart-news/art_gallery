      "prompt": "Within a claustrophobic, laterally extending corridor of polished obsidian, a regal figure\u2014an orbital matron adorned with dissolving geometries\u2014presides amidst the sickly sweet decay of a forgotten station, bathed in the feverish glow of a phantom sun that bleeds candy red across surfaces slick with toxic green luminescence, while a nearby sculpture, once representing ascension, now weeps viscous, chromatic trails as if remembering a fractured genesis, evoking a sense of beautiful, unsettling obsolescence and the lingering echoes of a synthetic divinity\u2014rendered with hyperrealism, intricate surface details showcasing peeling paint and corroded metal, emphasizing the contrast between the figure\u2019s unsettling serenity and the environment\u2019s chaotic collapse, reminiscent of Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski\u2019s dystopian visions filtered through a vaporwave aesthetic; the overall composition should feature volumetric lighting, subsurface scattering on the melting forms, and meticulous texture work to convey a sense of tangible, unsettling reality, pushing the boundaries of digital artistry towards photorealistic CGI with nuanced chromatic aberration and a high dynamic range for impactful visual storytelling\u2014a digital painting meant to instill wonder and disquiet in equal measure, exploring themes of transhumanism and the fragility of constructed realities.",
