The central figure, the \u201ctemporal crow lady\u201d, isn't necessarily humanoid in a traditional sense, but rather a being *emerging* from a fractal, reflective surface \u2013 imagine shattered glass reforming in a complex, almost biological pattern. Her form is subtly avian, suggestions of feathers and a beak manifested through the generative fractal design, rather than literal representations. \n\nThe color palette is predominantly a spectrum of mist greys, ranging from almost white to deep charcoal, creating a sense of ethereal decay and melancholic beauty.  Interrupting this greyscale is a vibrant, glowing orange; this isn\u2019t a flat colour, but rather a luminescence seemingly *from within* the figure and emanating along the fractal edges, as if the structure is internally lit. \n\n\u201cSymbiotic filaments\u201d appear as glowing, orange tendrils woven throughout her form and extending into the reflective surface, suggesting a co-dependent relationship between the being and the fractured reality. The \"blade glimmer\" isn\u2019t a literal blade, but rather the way light catches and refracts across the fractal surfaces, creating sharp, fleeting highlights reminiscent of polished metal.  \n\nRendering should prioritize subsurface scattering to create a sense of depth and organic quality within the geometric design. High-resolution textures, mimicking both organic and crystalline structures, will be crucial. The overall mood should be simultaneously awe-inspiring, unsettling, and deeply contemplative. Aim for a level of detail where microscopic fractal patterns are visible upon close inspection, giving the illusion of infinite complexity.",
