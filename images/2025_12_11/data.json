      "prompt": "A figure of sculpted, obsidian grace stands within a flickering corona of rose-tinged flames, her form subtly fractured with inner luminescence as though built from captured starlight and shadow, the air around her vibrating with barely contained energy revealed in delicate, branching pathways beneath a porcelain-like skin \u2013 a powerful, central presence radiating both ethereal beauty and unsettling mechanical precision, evoking the raw emotion of a forgotten deity resurrected through arcane technology, rendered in a style reminiscent of deeply textured impasto and bold, distorted forms, featuring a color scheme of swirling black iridescence and blushing amethyst, emphasizing a sense of spiritual intensity and the haunting fragility of synthetic life \u2013 a study in contrasts between the organic and the artificial, presented as a dramatically lit, high-resolution digital painting with intricate surface detail and subtle volumetric effects, leaning towards a cinematic quality with an expertly blended, slightly blurred background and hyperrealistic rendering of complex textures akin to detailed CGI, enhanced by advanced subsurface scattering and ray tracing to simulate lifelike skin and metallic components. The overall impression is one of solemn power and otherworldly grace, pushing the boundaries of both artistic expression and technical fidelity, capturing a moment of potent, almost painful creation.",
