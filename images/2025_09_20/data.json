      "prompt": "In a soaring digital tableau that feels both hyper\u2011realistic and otherworldly, a massive cloud leviathan, its vaporous mass swirling in layers of dim violet and burnished brass, looms within a tunnel\u2011vision scope that draws the eye inward like a vortex, the inverted sun behind it casting an eerie, backlit glare that paints the creature\u2019s billowing limbs in a cold, luminous aura while the datamosh aesthetic fractures the surrounding atmosphere into glitchy, pixel\u2011smeared fragments that ripple and glitch across the sky, and hovering arcane symbols\u2014glowing sigils of ancient power rendered in flickering cyan\u2011teal and amber\u2014drift lazily around its crown, their trails leaving brief after\u2011images that dissolve into the mist, while subtle CGI lighting sculpted with physically based rendering gives each condensate droplet a glass\u2011like translucency, the composition balanced by a chiaroscuro of shadow and reflected brass highlights that emphasize the leviathan\u2019s immense scale, and the overall mood is one of quiet apocalypse, a surreal blend of mythic grandeur and digital decay that feels like a high\u2011resolution concept art piece destined for a sci\u2011fi fantasy epic.",
