      "prompt": "From a dramatic low-angle that makes the figure tower like a mythic sentinel, a cloud shepherdess\u2014her flowing mantle woven from vapor\u2011kissed cumuli that shimmer with the fluid, reflective sheen of liquid chrome\u2014guides luminous, amorphous wisps across a night sky crowned by a faint, ethereal moon halo that casts a silvery rim around each puff, while the surrounding darkness is alive with the contrasting pulse of fire\u2011glow embers flickering against a deep shadow\u2011black void, her eyes alight with ancient wisdom and her hands poised over a colossal stone dais etched with time\u2011worn carvings of forgotten constellations and celestial beasts, the carvings catching the fire\u2011glow in their recessed grooves and throwing ghostly highlights that seem to breathe, all rendered in hyper\u2011realistic digital CGI detail that balances the sleek, mirror\u2011like reflections of the chrome clouds with the gritty texture of weathered stone, producing a breathtaking concept\u2011art portrait that feels both otherworldly and tangible, where every ripple of light and shadow tells a story of celestial guardianship and timeless reverence.",
