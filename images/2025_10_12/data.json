      "prompt": "A translucent glass phoenix maiden with intricate obsidian mechanical joints emerges from a neon\u2011lit, pixelated arcade tableau, her shimmering wings bathed in the cool, reflective glint of a temple\u2011style lantern, while a soft, cold illumination emanates from austere, metallic pillars studded with LEDs that flicker like distant stars, washing the scene in a restrained palette of golds and deep obsidian swirls that echo the ornate, metallic hull of a forgotten space cruiser, the fashionable retro arcade aesthetic is woven into every frame of this hyper\u2011realized portrait, with finely rendered motion blur, subtle anti\u2011aliasing, and the unmistakable hiss of old\u2011school sprite sheets punctuating her every grace; the cold temple light underscores the caustic play of reflection on her delicate glass armor, rendering each fragment of her feathers as if they were individually polished sapphire tiles; standing head\u2011on on a flat, almost two\u2011dimensional plane, the viewer is drawn into an immersive tableau where the phoenix\u2019s gold internal circulatory system glows like an ancient altar, the obsidian skeleton of her joints gleaming with neon circuitry, and the backdrop of a damp, grinding arcade humming with ghostly binary; the overall effect is a dazzling, high\u2011detail CGI illustration that marries nostalgic arcade heritage with cutting\u2011edge digital artistry while treating the subject with the meticulous realism and meticulous breathing that fans of couture digital portraiture would admire.",
