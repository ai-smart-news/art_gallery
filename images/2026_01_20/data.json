      "prompt": "A luminous, coral-infused nebula coalesces around the intricate inner workings of a fallen celestial being \u2013 a synthetic angel named Seraphina \u2013 rendered in gleaming chrome and bioluminescent circuitry, observed from above as if disassembled to reveal her starlight-powered core, her form dissolving into vaporous, void-black fog trails against a backdrop of pulsing, geometric light forms evocative of a retro-futuristic digital dreamscape, all bathed in the ethereal glow of distant, synthesized constellations, showcasing a hyperrealistic detail and crystalline clarity reminiscent of advanced CGI and concept art illustration, emphasizing her delicate robotic anatomy alongside the dramatic play of light and shadow, with a focus on textures \u2013 polished metal, softly glowing wires, and the ethereal quality of dissipating energy \u2013 capturing a poignant sense of both power and fragility within a vast, infinitely detailed synthetic universe, inspired by the vibrant aesthetic of synthwave and Blade Runner, pushing for photorealistic rendering combined with fantastical elements.",
