      "prompt": "A figure sculpted from fading recollections and burnished metal emerges from a fractured reality of chromatic skies, her form dissolving into swirling nebulas of nude bronze and shadowed forest ink, all perceived through a mosaic of splintered reflections dusted with the delicate decay of rust, evoking a hauntingly beautiful and fragmented dreamscape reminiscent of Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon\u2014a hyperrealistic digital painting rendered with intricate detail showcasing subsurface scattering on skin, meticulously textured metallic surfaces reflecting the ambient light, bioluminescent particles drifting within the cloudscape, and the subtle interplay of warm and cool tones creating emotional depth; the image should possess the quality of a highly detailed CGI render, featuring realistic fabric folds and hair strands, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the figure\u2019s melancholic expression, emphasizing the vulnerability and ephemeral nature of memory; a masterwork blending photorealism with symbolic artistry, created in 8k resolution with global illumination and ray tracing for maximum visual fidelity, aiming for a level of detail that invites close inspection and evokes a profound sense of nostalgia and loss while maintaining a cohesive and otherworldly atmosphere.",
