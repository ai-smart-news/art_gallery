      "prompt": "An ethereal, serpentine figure of glacial beauty undulates through crumbling, azure-lit stonework, her scales catching the faint glow of a forgotten shrine as tattered banners\u2014ghosts of former devotion\u2014drift around her like frozen smoke, all rendered in a delicate, flowing style reminiscent of blossoming ironwork and dissolving into a dreamlike focus where sharpness yields to atmospheric depth, evoking the mournful grandeur of a lost age and painted in shades of deepest, haunting sapphire and frosted cerulean, creating a hyperrealistic digital painting with intricate surface details, subsurface scattering on the scales to simulate translucency, and a subtle bloom effect mimicking long exposure photography, elevating the scene beyond simple illustration to a cinematic, otherworldly spectacle\u2014a testament to both power and decay, achieved with the nuanced lighting and organic forms characteristic of Art Nouveau, and the precision of modern CGI techniques ensuring photographic realism blended with fantastical elegance; the overall impression should be one of both delicate fragility and immense, ancient strength, as if witnessing a deity slowly fading from memory.",
