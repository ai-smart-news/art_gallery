The mention of \"hyperrealism,\" \"intricate feather detail,\" and \"subtle skin textures\" guides the AI towards photorealistic rendering where applicable (depending on the model's strengths).  The terms \"8k resolution\" and \"octane render\" *suggest* a very detailed output and high-quality lighting, though some models interpret these as stylistic directives rather than strict parameters. \n\n\"Cinematic lighting\" and \"volumetric fog\" encourage dramatic, atmospheric effects; the red sunset is implied and enhanced by the \u201cbleeding into the coming night\u201d portion.  The \"shards of a broken obsidian mirror\" inform the \"shattered glass framing\" element \u2013 framing isn\u2019t instructed *as* a frame, but emerges as a reflective, fragmented composition. \n\nThe specific artist references (Brom and Frank Frazetta) act as soft style prompts, leaning into the desired dark fantasy aesthetic. \"Concept art\" helps reinforce the idea of a highly-planned visual composition, pushing toward a detailed environment and character design. The intention is a character portrait contextualized within a wider, evocative scene, emphasizing a stoic, commanding presence.  The neutral third person phrasing (\"A regal figure...\") prevents the framing being too literal.",

      "prompt": "A solitary figure, cloaked in layered plates of darkened metal and woven bioluminescent fibers, stands silhouetted against a churning, phosphorescent nebula of silicon smoke and thick, algae-green fog, her form subtly illuminated from behind by a hidden, industrial heart radiating a cold, iron-grey glow \u2013 evoking a sense of ancient wisdom and mechanical veneration within a world perpetually shrouded in the haze of colossal, unseen engines, realized as a hyperdetailed digital painting with photorealistic textures emphasizing the interplay of corroded surfaces and softly glowing organic components, the scene capturing an ethereal portrait rendered with cinematic lighting and volumetric effects akin to concept art for a dieselpunk epic, leaning towards a highly refined CGI aesthetic with intricate detailing in the subject\u2019s attire and the atmospheric particulate matter, suggesting a narrative of a guardian spirit bound to a decaying, yet still powerful, technological lineage, rendered with immaculate clarity and a moody, dramatic atmosphere reminiscent of Greg Rutkowski and Simon St\u00e5lenhag, pushing the boundaries of digital artistry to achieve a breathtakingly immersive and emotionally resonant image.",
