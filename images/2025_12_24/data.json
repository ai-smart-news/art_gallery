      "prompt": "A solitary figure, draped in shifting, metallic grey veils, moves within a long, obscured passageway as fragmented echoes of time splinter across the stone walls, illuminated by the flickering, emerald glow of unseen flames casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the performer\u2019s ethereal motions \u2013 a study in minimalist form and subtly textured surfaces, rendered with the precision of flat design and the melancholic beauty of a forgotten ritual, evoking a sense of fractured memory and somber grace, the overall aesthetic leans towards a highly detailed digital painting with a cinematic quality, reminiscent of concept art for a fantastical, dystopian opera; imagine smooth gradients within the pewter tones of the fabric, subtly reflecting the petrol green light, with photorealistic textures on the fractured stone and a soft, almost volumetric haze hinting at the corridor\u2019s depth, the detail being so high one can almost feel the chill of the stone and the delicate weight of the veils.",
