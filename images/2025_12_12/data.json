      "prompt": "A figure wreathed in crimson luminescence and shadowed depths, seemingly forged from settled stardust and rebellious adornments, pulses with an inner light as delicate, vein-like structures bloom outwards, subtly distorting the space around them into a fractured dreamscape of intense focus and ethereal decay, evoking a beautifully tragic power born from fractured elegance and the resonant echo of forgotten experiments\u2014rendered as a hyperrealistic digital painting with intricate surface details, emphasizing the textures of aged metal, frayed fabrics, and bioluminescent growths, employing subsurface scattering to illustrate the skin\u2019s translucence where exposed, utilizing global illumination for dramatic interplay between the fiery halo and consuming darkness, and layered with chromatic aberration to highlight the otherworldly quality of the symbiotic filaments; the overall impression should feel like a still from a high-budget science fantasy film, leaning into a darkly romantic aesthetic with hints of both decay and flourishing life, achieving a photorealistic quality while maintaining an artistic, painterly feel evocative of Frank Frazetta meets Hajime Sorayama, pushing the boundaries of detail with 8k resolution and utilizing ray tracing for accurately simulated light and shadow, the final image should have a slight grain and a cinematic color grade.",
