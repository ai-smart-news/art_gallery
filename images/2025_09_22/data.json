      "prompt": "In a fog\u2011lit, echoing corridor that feels like the innermost sanctum of an ancient temple, a sinuous lava serpentess, its molten body sheathed in iridescent ghost\u2011blue crystaline scales that ripple like liquid fire, coils gracefully around an altar of polished obsidian while cold temple light filters through high arches, casting sharp, ethereal highlights and deep, velvety shadows that contrast with the dusky twilight hues suffusing the scene, and around her, vines of deep emerald pulse with inner luminous energy, their bioluminescent veins throbbing in rhythm with the creature\u2019s heartbeat, while the stone walls are etched with faint, sacred glyphs that seem to whisper forgotten prayers, a thin veil of incense\u2011kissed mist drifts lazily, catching and scattering the light into delicate, ghostly ribbons that intertwine with the energised foliage, all rendered in hyper\u2011realistic digital brushwork that merges CGI depth, photorealistic texture, and the painterly, reverent abstraction of sacral surrealism, creating a mesmerizing tableau where mythic ferocity and serene mysticism coexist in a single, breathtaking vision.",
