      "prompt": "Emerging from an ethereal, mist\u2011laden corner, a sleek, chrome\u2011leathered panther automa stands poised, its opulent, gilded chrome panels gleaming with the rich, Baroque splendor of ornate scrollwork and filigree, while a harsh, amber backlight filtered through wavering fog casts long, dream\u2011violet reflections across its polished alloy skin, and faint, rippling fog\u2011green hues swirl around the creature like a living aura, the entire scene rendered as a hyper\u2011realistic digital portrait that feels as if it were lifted from a gleaming CGI vault, complete with blood\u2011red tendrils of sonic distortion rings spiralling outward from the automa's temples and engine core, a subtle aura of ancient phonics echoing through the mist, the image framed from a corner\u2011peek perspective that gives the viewer the uncanny sensation of watching a phantom revel in a secret chamber of a forgotten cathedral, every brushed metal surface catching the waveringly lit vapors, every contour illuminated with a Baroque chiaroscuro that makes the viewer feel as though the mechanical beast is poised to leap out from the frame into a dream twilight.",
