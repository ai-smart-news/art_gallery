      "prompt": "Amid thunderous skies bruised with violet\u2011silver lightning and the furious whisper of howling winds, a storm sentinel queen rises from a shattered ether of turquoise\u2011hued clouds against a backdrop of shadow brown twilight, her regal silhouette rendered in a hyper\u2011realistic cutout collage style where translucent layers of fine parchment and glossy paper interweave with volumetric CGI textures, her jeweled crown glinting with quantum sparks of shimmering plasma that dance like miniature auroras across the cyclical fire\u2011lit ritual circle that radiates from her feet, each ember framing the symmetrical collapse perspective that compresses the world into a concentric vortex toward her palm, the fire illuminating the edges of her armor with a soft halo of amber and cobalt, her eyes reflecting the storm\u2019s fury and the calm of a thousand hidden galaxies, while the surrounding scene is suffused with an elegant palette of turquoise and shadow brown that washes through the folds of her cape, the collage cutouts paradoxically revealing layers of storm, myth, and maritime echoing upon every frame, creating an immersive digital masterpiece that feels both a towering portrait of sovereign resilience and a cinematic tableau of the cosmos, all under a finicky yet awe\u2011invoking sky that crackles with the improbable energy of quantum sparks, suggesting an otherworldly convergence of celestial physics and regal mystique.",
