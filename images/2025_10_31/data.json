      "prompt": "Within a vast, labyrinthine hallway that arches like a cathedral of broken marble, a colossal crystal giantess\u2014her translucent body glinting with facets of moonlit silver and sun-warmed amber\u2014stands amid the hushed ruins, her immense frame illuminated from within by a warm, orange sunset glow that seeps through the shattered rafters and bathes the scene in a soft, navy twilight haze, while intricate star charts, etched in glowing violet runes along the warped stone walls, swirl around her in a shimmering spiraling constellational map that echoes the ancient, forgotten heavens, all rendered in ultra\u2011realistic, photorealistic CGI with hyper\u2011detailed textures that give the crystal fabric a tangible, crystalline surface, every particle of dust a tiny prism refracting light, yet the overall composition remains ethereal, richly saturated with the counterpoint of sunset orange and deep navy hues, hinting at the lingering mystery of a shattered sky, while the curved hallway\u2019s illusion of infinite depth draws the viewer into a dreamlike, immersive digital masterpiece that blurs the boundaries between fantasy and hyper\u2011real visual storytelling.",
