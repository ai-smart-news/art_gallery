      "prompt": "From the cockpit\u2019s cramped, chrome\u2011laden interior, a lone pilot drifts in suspended silence, their cybernetic limbs twitching against the ship\u2019s humming frame, as flickering cherry\u2011red LEDs trace the contours of exposed mechanical joints and tubular circuitry, casting a soft, ambient glow that weaves through the void outside the viewport, where star\u2011dust swirls like distant petals against the endless black, and the pilot\u2019s own visor reflects a kaleidoscope of neon hues that pulse in rhythm with the ship\u2019s biopunk engine, while the air is thick with the hiss of compressed plasma and the faint scent of ozone, and every surface is layered with etched bio\u2011organic patterns that pulse faintly in sync with the pilot\u2019s heartbeat, creating a hyperrealistic, CGI\u2011styled portrait of a solitary traveler in a floating fortress, where the interplay of cherry\u2011red light and deep void shadows evokes a surreal, hauntingly beautiful atmosphere that feels both intimately personal and vast beyond comprehension.",
