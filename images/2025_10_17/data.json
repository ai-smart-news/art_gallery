      "prompt": "Within a swirling, neon-lit vortex of fragmented pixels the plasma valkyrie emerges, her translucent bronze armor glinting like molten steel in a kaleidoscopic sea of aquamarine and charcoal, her wings unfurled like rippling holographic screens that pulse with energised fractal patterns, every filamental detail rendered in high\u2011fidelity CGI as if captured through a fisheye lens that warps the world into a dizzying, all\u2011encompassing panorama, while the surrounding environment is collided with intentional datamosh distortion, sparks of broken code and glitchy bloom; the entire scene exudes a lens\u2011distorted light that bends, refracts, and reframes the figure in swirling, fractured amber shafts, casting dramatic shadows across her stalked limbs, and digital noise breathes life into the chaos, trembling across the canvas as static that seems to ripple like a plasma storm in motion, a masterpiece of photorealistic digital painting that feels simultaneously mythical and retro\u2011futuristic, an awe\u2011struck portrayal of mythic battle armor in technicolor glow.",
