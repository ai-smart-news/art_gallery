Think of the visual complexity found in high-end CGI renders, particularly relating to material definition \u2013 the obsidian should *feel* cool and dense, with internal refractions catching the sapphire light. The \u201csacred geometry\u201d isn\u2019t overt; instead, it manifests as naturally occurring fractal patterns *within* the antlers, illuminating from within like bioluminescence. \n\nThe \u201cunderwater perspective\u201d isn\u2019t about bubbles or direct water visibility, but about the distortion of light, the soft focus, and the feeling of immense pressure and depth. Colors should be rich and saturated, but tempered by the pervasive haze, creating a sense of mystery. The holographic interface shouldn\u2019t read as a simple overlay; it's integrated into the stag\u2019s form, like glowing veins or projections of data emanating from its core. \n\nIdeally, the final image feels like a portrait of a mythical being, simultaneously powerful and fragile. Consider elements of baroque lighting \u2013 dramatic highlights and shadows \u2013 softened by the diffuse haze.
