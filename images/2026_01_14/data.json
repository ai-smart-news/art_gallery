      "prompt": "A fractured divinity manifests as a solemn figure woven from conductive threads and archaic devotion, bisected by a mirroring chasm that reflects a city consumed by ethereal turquoise flames and shadowed umber decay\u2014an infinitely repeating panorama of collapsing towers and ascending circuitry, all rendered with photorealistic detail as though captured in a hyperdetailed digital painting, evoking the unsettling beauty of a Giger-esque biomechanical angel sculpted with the precision of a Greg Rutkowski illustration, the skin possessing a subtle subsurface scattering like polished obsidian, textures ranging from decaying velvet to gleaming chrome, a complex interplay of light and shadow emphasizing the figure\u2019s melancholic grace while the burning cityscape warps and distorts within the mirrored facets, presented as a high-resolution CGI artwork with global illumination and ambient occlusion for maximum depth and atmosphere, reminiscent of a pre-Raphaelite painting corrupted by digital glitches, highlights subtly catching the crystalline structures forming within the figure\u2019s headdress, a portrait of transcendent sorrow and technological ruin, pushing the boundaries of realistic rendering and surreal composition, generating a deeply immersive and visually arresting piece.",
