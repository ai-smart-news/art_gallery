      "prompt": "A spectral warrior, fractured and fading at the edges of perception, gazes out from behind a rain-streaked window layered with vibrant, chaotic glyphs, her form dissolving into a shimmering, neon-drenched abyss of pink and teal where the boundaries between flesh and light blur, evoking a sense of melancholic power and fleeting existence as if captured within a digital dreamscape rendered with photorealistic detail, utilizing advanced subsurface scattering to portray the decaying skin, meticulously crafted textures resembling layered spray paint and digital glitches, hyperdetailed facial features with subtle emotional nuance, bathed in the ethereal glow of impossible light sources, finished as a high-resolution CGI artwork blending the raw energy of street art with the delicate beauty of a traditional ukiyo-e portrait, utilizing volumetric lighting and atmospheric perspective to create immense depth and a hauntingly beautiful, emotionally resonant image\u2014a digital painting focused on portraying a bittersweet moment of loss and resilience, pushing the boundaries of realistic representation with subtly stylized features reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha illustrations, resulting in a striking and unforgettable visual narrative.",
