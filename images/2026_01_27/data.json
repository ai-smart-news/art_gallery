      "prompt": "A sovereign figure, etched in the style of ancient wash painting, commands the failing heart of a subterranean forge, her presence radiating a somber authority as crimson and charcoal hues swirl around fracturing obsidian architecture, a symmetrical distortion framing her form while luminescent fissures bloom across her skin like molten glyphs \u2013 a portrait rendered with photorealistic detail, imbued with the ethereal quality of digital painting, achieved through advanced CGI techniques, showcasing subsurface scattering on her porcelain skin and the delicate texture of smoke clinging to her elaborate, dark-lacquered robes, the complex interplay of light mimicking the glow of thermal energy, her expression a blend of weary vigilance and immutable power, the entire scene sculpted with the nuance of classical eastern artistry yet grounded in hyperrealism, suggesting both immense age and the devastation of a dying world, a compelling fusion of organic forms and geometric decay, presented as a high-resolution, intricately detailed artwork intended for cinematic framing; think Yoshitaka Amano meets Greg Rutkowski, utilizing a volumetric lighting model and breathtaking depth of field, a full body shot avoiding any lens distortions, every element contributing to a sense of profound loss and unwavering resilience.",
