      "prompt": "In a dimly lit, swamp\u2011infused fog, a sonic knightess stands poised behind a cracked brass rail, her armor a swirling cascade of brushed iron and polished copper, its gears and pistons emitting faint, resonant chiming that echo like distant waves, while a lattice of translucent, violet glass shards reflects the greenish hue of the marsh, casting fractured geometric patterns across her visor and gauntleted hands, and the whole scene is rendered in ultra\u2011realistic CGI with a tunnel\u2011vision perspective that squeezes the viewer into a narrow corridor of brass tubes and flickering phosphorescent algae, each bolt and rivet illuminated by the subtle, amber glow of bioluminescent spores, so that the metallic sheen of her cloak is interlaced with faint, phosphor\u2011lit embroidery that mimics insect wings, and the ambient swamp light filters through tall, gnarled cypress, creating a chiaroscuro interplay of shadow and violet, the overall palette saturated with deep violet, muted brass, and hints of emerald, while steam rises from vented exhausts and forms ghostly silhouettes that dance among the carved geometric motifs etched into the surrounding stone walls, all of which culminates into a high\u2011detail digital illustration that feels like a cinematic concept art board of an otherworldly, steampunk citadel set amidst a marsh, with the sonic knightess as its beating heart and resonant guardian, her eyes glowing faintly like opalescent lenses that seem to hold a storm of sound that pulses and ripples with the very breath of the fog, inviting any viewer to step through the portal and feel the echoing hum of a forgotten, brass\u2011laden empire.",
