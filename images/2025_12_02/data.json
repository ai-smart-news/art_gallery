      "prompt": "A crystalline dragoness, scales shimmering with an internal luminescence, fractures the twilight as she soars through a digitized stormscape of violet and steel, her form dissolving at the edges into cascading streams of time-locked particles and echoing neon geometries, all rendered with hyperrealistic detail in the style of a chaotic bloom, revealing fractured reflections of a forgotten cityscape below as if captured from a distant, sweeping aerial panorama\u2014a digital painting exhibiting photorealistic rendering, intricate scale textures, and dynamic lighting effects achieved through global illumination and subsurface scattering, emphasizing the blend of organic and synthetic forms; the dragoness's eyes glow with contained energy, casting violet highlights across her features; the composition utilizes dramatic perspective and depth of field to draw the viewer into the scene, mimicking the visual language of 1980s synthwave album art but pushed to a new level of detail using advanced CGI and concept art techniques, resulting in a striking and immersive artwork that evokes a sense of powerful, ethereal beauty and technological wonder, inspired by Greg Rutkowski and Beeple, further enhanced by ray tracing and detailed atmospheric scattering for volumetric light effect.",
