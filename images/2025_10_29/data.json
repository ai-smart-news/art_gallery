      "prompt": "Amid the hushed, moonlit haze of a forgotten airfield, a translucent, spectral aviatrix with iridescent, feathered wings draped over her ethereal form stands poised at the center of a clandestine ritual circle where crimson flames curl like serpents around ancient sand stones, the scene rendered in the stark, high-contrast chiaroscuro of classic film noir yet bathed in a melancholic palette of deep plum shadows that bleed into warm, sun-baked sand tones, her skeletal frame fused with intricate mechanical bones that gleam with brass and steel filigree, each joint a subtle testament to a once-robust engineering marvel now haunted by a lingering spirit, the entire composition captured from a rotated tilt perspective that tilts the viewer\u2019s gaze upward into the night, teasing the horizon with impossible angles that echo the dizzying flight of a vintage propeller, the portrait\u2019s realism amplified by meticulous CGI detailing that gives textures to her spectral skin, the flickering fire\u2019s glow reflected in the metallic ribs, and the overall digital artwork feels like an elegant, immersive narrative captured in one breathtaking, surreal moment.",
