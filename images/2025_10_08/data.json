      "prompt": "In the heart of a neon\u2011bleached metropolis where the skyline blazes with molten glass and flickering holographic banners, a masked enchantress emerges from the shadows, her silver\u2011lace mask glinting with moonstone iridescence, her eyes a pale wine hue that seem to hold the secrets of forgotten star\u2011touched temples, her translucent robes swirling with subtle, shimmering circuitry that pulse in sync with invisible magnetic waves, the air around her crackling with the electric hum of unseen generators, the extreme close\u2011up framing her face so that every delicate fold of her mask, every faint scar that glows like a faint aurora, the faint veins of bioluminescent circuitry along her neck, and the faint ripple of magnetic pulses that distort the very air around her combine to create a scene that feels both eerily sacred and wildly futuristic, an image that would be rendered in hyper\u2011realistic digital artistry, as if a CGI painter had poured starlight and circuitry into a single frame, ensuring each pixel radiates with the cool mystique of moonstone and the warm, intoxicating undertone of pale wine, while the burning skyline behind her blazes with a crimson glow that reflects off her mask, turning the entire composition into a living, breathing testament to the fusion of ancient ritual and cutting\u2011edge technology.",
